This document describes the facet calibration software that implements the facet calibration scheme described in van Weeren et al. (in prep.) and Williams et al. (in prep.). This software was written by the Calibration and Imaging Tiger Team, principally Timothy Shimwell (pre-facet calibration), David Rafferty (Factor), and Stefan Fr√∂hlich (generic pipeline framework) and is based on (or directly includes) Python scripts developed by Reinout van Weeren, Wendy Williams, Martin Hardcastle, Jose Sabater Montes, and Francesco de Gasperin.

If you use the results of this software in a publication or presentation, please cite van Weeren et al. (in prep.).
